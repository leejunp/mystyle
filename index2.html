      <h2 class="first">What's the one word you want people to feel when they see your work?</h2>
      <p>Wow.</p>
      <p>When people look at my work, I want them to feel awe. Wheather that's due to the quality of the work or its creativity, I want to leave an everlasting impression on the viewer. I think the most powerful ability one has as an artist is our capability to change trends and people's thoughts.  Eventually, I wish to make work evoking enough to use such abilities to my advantage. </p>
      <h2>What do you value?</h2>
      <p>I value good design. As a self-driven person, I spend my time watching tutorials, reading articles and finding references in order to better myself as an artist. Not only is design my line of work, it is my passion and my hobby. Naturally, I began spending a lot of time looking at great art: pieces that stun me with its intricate details or those that capture the audience with its creativity.  My goal is to become the artist that creates such work.</p>
      <h2>How will you impact others in a positive way?</h2>
      <p>Though I am not very certain on how to answer this question, I would like for my work to eventually become something people can use as a reference. For my piece to be good enough to spark new ideas, for it to aid those stuck on projects, and for it to be respected. I think this is the dream of most artists, actually. Leaving their name behind with a bang.</p>
      <h2>What are you passionate about?</h2>
      <p>I am passionate about the unknown. To endlessly chase after ideas and endlessly learn. This logic is not limited to art. If possible, I want to learn everything. Thankfully I was born with an extremely bored mind; not being able to go five minutes without itching for an activity helps me through this process. Don't you think it's wonderful? The chase eternal chase after mystery?</p>

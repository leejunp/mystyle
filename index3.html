      <h2 class="first">What are you skilled at doing?</h2>
      <p>I'd like to believe that I am good at being persistent. In my life, I have experienced a countless number of failures and rejections. If I have become good at anything in my life, it would be to never give up. My dad would always tell me, "In life, it is simply never too late to start anything. If you want to get a Ph.D. when you're 90, go for it. When you hesitate and let go of that chance, that's how you live with the biggest regret residing in your heart."</p>
      <h2>How can you make money?</h2>
      <p>By creating. Looking at the richest people on earth, they all have something in common: they created something new. Steve Jobs? He created the link between design and computers. Bill Gates? He created Windows. Jeff Bezos? He created an online marketplace. They all changed trends and created a new beginning. So, I just need to do exactly that.</p>
      <h2>What companies would you love to work for?</h2>
      <p>Our world is becoming more and more digitalized. We spend more time staring at our phones and monitors than we spend talking. So in this era, I believe the best way to spread my work is by being a part of a technology-based company. As a nerd, I would love to work for Riot, Blizzard or Discord. Realistically, my goal is to work for Google or Amazon. After saving up enough money, I would love to freelance and be creative. </p>
      <h2>What are some characteristics of your ideal workplace?</h2>
      <p>A place where I can express my opinions and have them be heard. A place where I can be creative and fun. But most importantly, free things! Free food, sketchbooks, stickers, pens, and more because I love free things :)</p>
      <h2>What kind of work do you want to be doing?</h2>
      <p>I wish to do UX/UI design. Though I am still a novice at coding or website design, I am trying my best to learn the trends. I've been spending hours on HTML, CSS, and JS these last three years, hoping to get better as I go on. I truly enjoy being crunched up on my chair, tip-tapping my time away and ripping my hair out as I try to debug the missing semi-colon.</p>
